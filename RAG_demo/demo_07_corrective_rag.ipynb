    "# Demo #7: Corrective RAG (Self-Reflective Retrieval)\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🎯 Learning Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "In this demonstration, you will learn:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Retrieval Quality Evaluation**: How to assess the relevance of retrieved documents using LLM-based grading\n",
    "2. **Self-Corrective Mechanisms**: How to implement conditional workflows based on retrieval assessment\n",
    "3. **Fallback Strategies**: How to trigger alternative paths (re-retrieval, web search, direct generation)\n",
    "4. **Adaptive Behavior**: How to build RAG systems that \"reflect\" on their own performance\n",
    "\n",
    "## 📚 Theoretical Background\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Problem with Static RAG Pipelines\n",
    "\n",
    "Traditional RAG systems follow a fixed pipeline: **Retrieve → Generate**. They assume that:\n",
    "- The retrieved documents are always relevant\n",
    "- The knowledge base contains the answer\n",
    "- The retrieval method successfully found the right content\n",
    "\n",
    "However, these assumptions often fail in practice, leading to common failure modes:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Common RAG Failure Points (from the curriculum)\n",
    "\n",
    "- **FP1: Missing Content (Corpus Failure)**: The knowledge base doesn't contain the answer → System may hallucinate\n",
    "- **FP2: Missed Top Ranked (Retrieval Failure)**: The correct document exists but isn't retrieved → Poor answers despite good data\n",
    "- **FP3: Not in Context (Post-Retrieval Failure)**: Document was retrieved but filtered out → Information loss\n",
    "- **FP4: Not Extracted (Generation Failure)**: Answer is in context but LLM fails to extract it → Wasted retrieval effort\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Corrective RAG Solution\n",
    "\n",
    "Corrective RAG (CRAG) introduces a **self-reflective layer** between retrieval and generation:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Traditional RAG:  Query → Retrieve → Generate\n",
    "\n",
    "Corrective RAG:   Query → Retrieve → EVALUATE → [Route Decision]\n",
    "                                        ↓\n",
    "                        ┌───────────────┼───────────────┐\n",
    "                        ↓               ↓               ↓\n",
    "                   RELEVANT      PARTIALLY         NOT RELEVANT\n",
    "                        ↓           RELEVANT            ↓\n",
    "                   Generate    Re-retrieve +       Web Search\n",
    "                               Transform            Fallback\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Components\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Relevance Grader**: An LLM-based critic that scores retrieval quality (1-5 scale)\n",
    "2. **Decision Logic**: Conditional routing based on relevance scores\n",
    "3. **Corrective Actions**:\n",
    "   - **High Relevance (4-5)**: Proceed with standard generation\n",
    "   - **Medium Relevance (2-3)**: Trigger query transformation and re-retrieval\n",
    "   - **Low Relevance (<2)**: Fall back to web search or direct LLM knowledge\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why This Matters\n",
    "\n",
    "Corrective RAG transforms the system from a **blind executor** into a **reflective agent** that:\n",
    "- **Detects its own failures** before producing bad answers\n",
    "- **Takes corrective action** to improve retrieval quality\n",
    "- **Falls back gracefully** when knowledge is missing\n",
    "- **Reduces hallucinations** by recognizing insufficient context\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🔧 Implementation\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll implement a complete Corrective RAG system with:\n",
    "- A deliberately limited corpus (to trigger failure scenarios)\n",
    "- An LLM-based relevance grader\n",
    "- Three retrieval paths (standard, corrective, fallback)\n",
    "- Test queries designed to exercise each path"

      "The self-attention mechanism in transformer architecture is a process that allows each position in a sequence to consider and attend to all other positions within the sequence. This is achieved through the scaled dot-product attention formula, which involves computing attention scores using query, key, and value vectors. The importance of self-attention lies in its ability to capture relationships between tokens regardless of their distance in the sequence, enabling the model to understand context and dependencies more effectively. This mechanism facilitates parallel processing, enhances the model's ability to capture long-range dependencies, and contributes to the overall efficiency and performance of transformers in various tasks.\n",

      "Language models that handle bidirectional context, like BERT, process text in both directions simultaneously, allowing them to understand the context surrounding each word more comprehensively. This approach contrasts with unidirectional models, which process text either left-to-right or right-to-left, limiting their ability to capture context from both sides of a word. Bidirectional models use techniques such as masked language modeling to predict masked tokens based on the surrounding context, enhancing their ability to understand nuanced language patterns and relationships.\n",

      "Containerizing machine learning models with Docker and Kubernetes involves several best practices to ensure efficiency, scalability, and maintainability. Here are some key practices:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Use Lightweight Base Images**: Start with a minimal base image to reduce the size of your container. Alpine Linux is a popular choice for its small footprint.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Separate Dependencies**: Clearly define and separate dependencies in your Dockerfile. Use a requirements.txt file for Python dependencies and install only what's necessary.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Optimize Dockerfile**: Write efficient Dockerfiles by minimizing the number of layers. Combine commands where possible and use caching effectively to speed up builds.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Environment Variables**: Use environment variables to configure your application, making it easier to manage different configurations for development, testing, and production.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Model Versioning**: Implement a versioning system for your models to keep track of changes and ensure reproducibility. This can be done using tags in Docker images.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. **Security Practices**: Regularly update your base images and dependencies to patch vulnerabilities. Use Docker's security features, like user namespaces, to enhance security.\n",
      "\n",
      "7. **Resource Requests and Limits**: In Kubernetes, define resource requests and limits for your containers to ensure efficient resource utilization and avoid overconsumption.\n",
      "\n",
      "8. **Horizontal Scaling**: Design your application to be stateless and scalable. Use Kubernetes features like ReplicaSets and Horizontal Pod Autoscaler to manage scaling.\n",
      "\n",
      "9. **Monitoring and Logging**: Implement monitoring and logging solutions to track the performance and health of your containers. Tools like Prometheus and Grafana can be integrated with Kubernetes for this purpose.\n",
      "\n",
      "10. **CI/CD Integration**: Automate the build and deployment process using CI/CD pipelines. This ensures consistent and repeatable deployments.\n",
      "\n",
      "11. **Network Policies**: Use Kubernetes network policies to control the communication between pods, enhancing security and performance.\n",
      "\n",
      "12. **Persistent Storage**: If your application requires persistent storage, use Kubernetes Persistent Volumes and Persistent Volume Claims to manage storage efficiently.\n",
      "\n",
      "By following these best practices, you can effectively containerize and manage machine learning models using Docker and Kubernetes, ensuring they are scalable, secure, and maintainable.\n",

      "Answer: Containerizing machine learning models with Docker is a popular approach to ensure consistency, scalability, and portability across different environments. Here are some best practices for containerizing machine learning models:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Use a Lightweight Base Image**: Start with a lightweight base image, such as Alpine or a minimal version of Ubuntu, to reduce the size of your Docker image. This helps in faster deployment and reduces resource consumption.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Separate Dependencies**: Clearly define and separate your dependencies. Use a requirements file (e.g., `requirements.txt` for Python) to list all necessary libraries and packages. This ensures that your environment is reproducible.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Optimize Dockerfile**: Write efficient Dockerfiles by minimizing the number of layers. Combine commands where possible and avoid installing unnecessary packages. Use multi-stage builds to separate build and runtime dependencies.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Environment Variables**: Use environment variables to configure your application. This allows you to change configurations without modifying the code or rebuilding the image.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Model Versioning**: Implement model versioning to keep track of different versions of your model. This can be done by tagging Docker images with version numbers or using a versioning system within your application.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. **Security Practices**: Follow security best practices by running containers with the least privilege necessary. Avoid running containers as root and use Docker's security features to limit access.\n",
      "\n",
      "7. **Logging and Monitoring**: Implement logging and monitoring within your containerized application to track performance and diagnose issues. Use tools like Prometheus, Grafana, or ELK stack for monitoring and logging.\n",
      "\n",
      "8. **Testing**: Test your containerized application thoroughly in different environments to ensure it behaves as expected. Use CI/CD pipelines to automate testing and deployment.\n",
      "\n",
      "9. **Resource Management**: Define resource limits for your containers to prevent them from consuming excessive resources. Use Docker's resource management features to set CPU and memory limits.\n",
      "\n",
      "10. **Documentation**: Provide clear documentation on how to build, run, and deploy your Docker containers. Include instructions for setting up the environment and troubleshooting common issues.\n",

    "## 🎓 Key Takeaways\n",
    "\n",
    "### What We Learned\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Self-Reflection Prevents Failures**\n",
    "   - Traditional RAG blindly proceeds with retrieved context, even if irrelevant\n",
    "   - Corrective RAG evaluates quality BEFORE generation, preventing hallucinations\n",
    "   - LLM-as-judge provides flexible, semantic quality assessment\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Adaptive Routing Improves Robustness**\n",
    "   - High relevance → Standard path (efficient)\n",
    "   - Medium relevance → Corrective action (query transformation, re-retrieval)\n",
    "   - Low relevance → Fallback (web search, direct LLM, or \"I don't know\")\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Failure Modes Mapping**\n",
    "   - **FP1 (Missing Content)**: Detected by Path C (not relevant) → Fallback triggered\n",
    "   - **FP2 (Missed Ranking)**: Detected by Path B (partial) → Re-retrieval with HyDE\n",
    "   - **FP3-FP5**: Can be caught post-generation with additional grading\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Production Considerations**\n",
    "   - Relevance grading adds latency (extra LLM call)\n",
    "   - Can cache grading decisions for similar queries\n",
    "   - Threshold tuning (4-5, 2-4, <2) depends on domain\n",
    "   - Web search integration provides genuine fallback capability\n",
    "\n",
    "### Architectural Insights\n",
    "\n",
    "Corrective RAG represents a fundamental shift:\n",
    "- From **passive retrieval** to **active quality control**\n",
    "- From **fixed pipelines** to **adaptive workflows**\n",
    "- From **blind generation** to **self-aware systems**\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a bridge between traditional RAG and fully Agentic RAG, where the system begins to reason about its own capabilities and limitations.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Next Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "To extend this implementation:\n",
    "1. **Add Web Search**: Integrate Bing/Google API for Path C\n",
    "2. **Multi-Pass Correction**: Allow multiple re-retrieval attempts\n",
    "3. **Post-Generation Validation**: Add faithfulness grading after answer generation\n",
    "4. **Confidence Calibration**: Tune thresholds based on domain-specific evaluation\n",
    "5. **Logging & Monitoring**: Track path distribution to identify corpus gaps\n",
